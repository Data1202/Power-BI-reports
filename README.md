The report says, comparing the crime rates between Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia stated that Ontario has its highest crime rate in year 2020, Manitoba has its highest crime rate in year 2015 and British Columbia is full of criminals peaking from 201-2015. The comparison between crime rates for top 3 cities of Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia – the report states that British Columbia has the higher crime cities named as Quesnel, Prince George and Vancouver. The report Determined there is a correlation between youth crime and adult crime for each high crime rate city – it states that the adult people are the ones who has the higher rate of criminals as compared to the Youth. Crime Rate prediction: Predict amount of crime for Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia from a province perspective – the report states that British Columbia has been on top always in crime rates as compared to Ontario and Manitoba. The power BI was supposed to give me analytics for forecasting the next year’s crime rate but due to some technical glitch it is incomplete. As per me, the British Columbia is leading the way of high crime rates among all and will continue growing if the appropriate measures would not be taken to lessen the crimes and criminals.
